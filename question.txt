Theoretical Question:
    Explain in your own words what AJAX is and how it is useful in JavaScript development:

AJAX, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a rad tech for JavaScript! It makes websites more 
interactive without annoying reloads. When you do stuff on a site, AJAX quietly talks to the server
without stopping you. It uses XML or JSON to organize data between the server and the page. The cool
thing is it can update just parts of a page, no need for a full reload. AJAX is like the secret sauce 
to make websites awesome and responsive. It's a must-know for web dev students!
